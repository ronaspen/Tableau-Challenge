# Tableau-Challenge

Just to explain the dataset I used:

I downlaoded 6 individual csv files from the Citi Bike Data webpage.

They were:
June 2023, July 2023, August 2023 (The summer months)
as well as 
December 2023, January 2024, February 2023 (The winter months)

I then used pandas (jupyter notebook) to first individually join June, July and August, and export the whole dataset as a 'summer months' excel file 

I did the same with joining December, Jan and Feb, and exported it to a 'winter months' excel file.

I then joined both the summer and winter excel files on another jupyter notebook, and exported it as a new excel file. 

I uploaded this summer/winter combined excel file to Tableau, and this is the file I used for the visualisations
